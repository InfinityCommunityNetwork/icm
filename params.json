{"name":"Infinity Community Manager","tagline":"Infinity Community Manager is a community directory and relations management site for Infinity MMO","body":"Infinity_Corp_Manager\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nRepo for the (open-source variant) Infinity Corp Manager project\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n============\r\nThe Infinity Corp Manager project started out as a project with a dual purpose. My primary goal when writing the ICM was to teach myself PHP, and I have certainly learnt a lot so far on this journey. However, the project is still a long way from being fully usable, so I felt my duty came to turn this over to the open domain. As such, please assume that this code is under CC BY-SA-NC until otherwise specified in a license file. You MAY fork this project and you MAY create your own derived work from this code. I'd very much like to receive credit for my part of the code though and would kindly ask that people not try to make money (directly) off it.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n===================\r\nYou'll need the following on your system to run the ICM\r\n* PHP\r\n* MySQL\r\n* A HTTP webserver, like Apache\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nIt's worth noting that this is very much still not suitable for public use. Only download if you're comfortable with fiddling with code.\r\n\r\n1. Pull the desired branch from the repository using your favourite git shell. (I can highly recommend GitHub's Windows GUI client)\r\n2. If you've put them in a folder you're not intending to use for web-hosting, move them to a public-facing location (like a web server)\r\n3. Navigate to /install.php and enter your DB credentials and anything else mentioned\r\n4. That should be it. Navigate to /index.php, create a user, and get cracking.\r\n\r\nContributions\r\n=============\r\nI still very much want to work on this project myself to continue to aid my learning process, but I'll accept pull requests on the following basis\r\n\r\n* Your code is readable and has good indentation and is commented where relevant\r\n* You can demonstrate that your code has actually been tested and works\r\n* You are willing to teach me about your code's functionality if I am unfamiliar with it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
